            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Using Version Control Systems is way to record all changes to a file or set of files over time. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a version control system allows you to go back if you make a mistake or lose a file, it makes things easy to recover. There are different types of version control systems including local, centralized, and distributed.

                <span class="text-muted">VCS Advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a lot of advantages to using version control systems. Like mentioned in the first highlight it is easy to keep track of all changes ever made to a files or files and easily go back and make changes should anything ever happen. In local version control you copy files into another directory. This approach is simple but error prone, it is easy to forget which directory you put a file in. Centralized control systems allow for multiple users to make changes to the same files at once. It uses a single server that contains all the files and that all users have access to. Distributed version control systems keep a copy on both the local and the centralized servers so everyone has a copy and there is less likely a chance of losing any previous work if a system were to fail.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A software repository is where the data is stored from which software packages can be retrieved and installed on a computer.  While using Git, you need to understand how to configure and initialize a repository, how to begin and stop tracking files, and commit changes. Git allows for easy learning on how to set up and use a repository. They also set up the repository so there can be an easy undo of mistakes and show us how to search the history of our repository. We are also able to look at the difference between commits and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system that anyone can use and is used by big name companies around the world like Facebook and Netflix. The birth of Git followed the failure of the Linux kernel as the changes to those files were passed around in archives. Git was designed to allow multiple user access to files with speed, simple design, support for non-linear development, and efficiency. Since 2005 when Git was born it has evolved to become easy to use, incredibly fast, and very efficient with large projects. It also has an incredible branching system fir non linear development.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git, unlike other version control systems, thinks of its data as a set of snapshots of a mini file system. Every time you commit, save, the project you are working on Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment and keeps it as a reference. Most operations on Git only need local files to operate which means internet connection is not always needed. It also means that Git doesnâ€™t need to go out to the server to display the project history to you since a copy is saved on the local database. It is nearly impossible to make changes to any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
